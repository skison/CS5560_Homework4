### CS5560 Midterm - Samuel Kison
This MEAN application allows users to add and store stock data online.

More specifically, this application fulfills these features:
* Investment portfolios are protected and require authentication to be displayed
* Only the portfolio that is relevant to the authenticated user is displayed
* Provides users the capability to create investment positions
* Provides users the capability to delete investment positions
* Provides users the capability to update investment positions
* Relevant investment positions are stored in a table; each row shows the position's symbol, amount, buy price, total buy price, current value, and total current value
* A performance bar chart of the data is rendered using an implementation of D3; this chart shows stock's total buy price, total current value, and percentage increase/decrease in value
* All data is securely stored in a MongoDB database
